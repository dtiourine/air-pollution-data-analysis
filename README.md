## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air pollution data to identify trends, peaks in pollutant levels, and to provide insights into the air quality over a specified period. The goal is to contribute to environmental science by providing actionable insights through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from [OpenWeatherMap's Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution), which provides historical air pollution data including various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and NOx levels.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scripts to fetch and store air pollution data.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying trends and patterns in the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and plots to illustrate the data insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting future pollution levels using statistical models.

## Requirements
This project uses Python and several libraries for data analysis and visualization. To install the required libraries, run:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy requests
